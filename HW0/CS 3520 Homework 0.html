Change to the <b>New User</b> panel, and pick a username and password. (Use your real name and real Utah student ID, so that we can connect your homework submissions with you.)</p><p>You will have to install <tt>uu-cs3520</tt> for DrRacket on each different filesystem that you use to get a <b>Handin</b> button. However, after creating a handin account once from any machine, you can use DrRacket’s <b>Handin</b> button on any other machine.</p><p>Use <tt>#lang plait</tt> at the start of your program, so that it’s implemented in the Plait language.</p><h3>Part 1 — <span>Implement <tt>3rd-power</tt></span></h3><p>Define the function <tt>3rd-power</tt>, which takes a number and raises it to the 3rd power.</p><p>Your program should include <tt>test</tt> forms to check <tt>3rd-power</tt> on a few inputs.</p><p>Example use: <tt>(3rd-power 17)</tt> should produce <tt>4913</tt>.</p><h3>Part 2 — <span>Implement <tt>42nd-power</tt></span></h3><p>Define the function <tt>42nd-power</tt> (in the same program), which takes a number and raises it to the 42nd power.</p><p>It’s probably a good idea to use functions like <tt>3rd-power</tt> to build up to <tt>42nd-power</tt>.</p><p>Your program should include <tt>test</tt> forms to check <tt>42nd-power</tt> on a few inputs.</p><p>Example use: <tt>(42nd-power 17)</tt> should produce <tt>4773695331839566234818968439734627784374274207965089</tt>.</p><h3>Part 3 — <span>Implement <tt>plural</tt></span></h3><p>Define <tt>plural</tt>, which takes a string and returns a string. If the given string ends in “y”, the the result should be the same as the input but with the “y” replaced by “ies”. Otherwise, the result should be the same as the given string with “s” added to the end.</p><p>Your program should include <tt>test</tt> forms to check <tt>plural</tt> on a few inputs.</p><p>Example uses: <tt>(plural "baby")</tt> should produce <tt>"babies"</tt>, while <tt>(plural "fish")</tt> should produce <tt>"fishs"</tt>.</p><h3>Part 4 — <span>Implement <tt>energy-usage</tt></span></h3><p>Use the following type definition (add it to your program):</p><pre>  (define-type Light
    (bulb [watts : number]
          [technology : symbol])
    (candle [inches : number]))
</pre><p>Implement the function <tt>enery-usage</tt>, which takes a <tt>Light</tt> and produces the number of kilowatthours of electricity that the light uses in 24 hours. Your function will need to use <tt>(type-case Light ....)</tt>.</p><p>As always, include relevant <tt>test</tt> forms.</p><p>Example uses: <tt>(energy-usage (bulb 100.0 'halogen))</tt> should produce <tt>2.4</tt>, while <tt>(energy-usage (candle 10.0))</tt> should produce <tt>0.0</tt> or <tt>0</tt>.</p><h3>Part 5 — <span>Implement <tt>use-for-one-hour</tt></span></h3><p>Implement the function <tt>use-for-one-hour</tt>, which takes a <tt>Light</tt> and produces another <tt>Light</tt> that represents the given light source after it is used for another hour. Assume that a candle burns one inch per hour (unless it is already gone), and assume that a lightbulb is the same after one hour of use.</p><p>Example uses: <tt>(use-for-one-hour (bulb 100.0 'halogen))</tt> should produce <tt>(bulb 100.0 'halogen)</tt>, while <tt>(use-for-one-hour (candle 10.0))</tt> should produce <tt>(candle 9.0)</tt>.</p><h3>Part 6 — Handin</h3><p>Click the <b>Handin</b> button in DrRacket to submit your homework. The <b>Handin</b> button submits whatever is in DrRacket’s definitions area, so click <b>Handin</b> after you ave defined <tt>3rd-power</tt>, <tt>42nd-power</tt>, <tt>plural</tt>, <tt>energy-usage</tt>, and <tt>use-for-one-hour</tt>, all in the same program.</p><p>The handin process will check that you have defined the right
names. It will also run some tests on your programs. If tests fail,
then your handin will not be accepted—but you can override that by
clicking <b>Submit even if server reports problems</b>. That checkbox
won’t override very basic problems, however, such as not using
<tt>#lang plait</tt> or submitting a program that doesn’t compile.</p><p>You can double-check that handin was successful by visiting the
<b>Solutions and your handins</b> link at the top right of the
<a href="https://pubweb.eng.utah.edu/~cs3520/schedule.html">schedule page</a>. Log in with the account
that you created for handin. You can check whether a submission has
been uploaded, you can check the time of the upload, and you can
download your submission. Solutions and grades for your assignments
will appear later in that same place.</p><hr><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td align="right">Last update: Friday, September 14th, 2018<address>mflatt@cs.utah.edu</address></td></tr></tbody></table>
